## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Question 1:

In supervised learning, for each observation of the predictor
measurement X, there is an associated response measurement Y (AKA
supervisor). In unsupervised learning, for each observation, we observe
a vector of measurements X but no associated response Y. The difference
between these two is that unsupervised learning have to learn without a
supervisor and it is not posible to fit certain models because there is
no response variable to predict (From page #26 of book)

Question 2:

In regression model, Y is a quantitative response, and takes on
numerical values like price and blood pressure while in classification
model, Y is a qualitative response, and takes on categorical values like
survived/died, etc.

However, the intriguing part is that Least squares linear regression
used with a quantitative response, whereas logistic regression is
typically used with a qualitative (two-class, or binary) response. (From
page #28 of book)

Question 3: None

Question 4:

-   Descriptive models: choose model to visually emphasize a trend in
    data (using a line on a scatterplot).
-   Inferential models: aim to test theories, find the possible
    correlation and causality, and state relationship between outcome
    and predictor.
-   Predictive models: aim to predict Y with minimum reducible error and
    not focused on hypothesis test.(from the lecture)

Question 5:

-   mechanistic: mechanistic modeling assume a parametric form for f.
    The more parameters, the more flexibility

-   empirically-driven: assume no parametric form for f. Instead, it
    requires a larger number of observation for the prediction. The
    original default is more fexible.

The similarity between these two model is that they both have the
problem of overfitting. (from the lecture)

Question 6:

I reckon the first one is a inferential question because data can be
used to form a implicit analysis based on the voter's past voting
proclivity. This is to test a theory that how likely these voters will
vote for the candidate by looking at their old data. It is something of
evaluating the relationship between the predictor (past data) and
response variables (how likely now).

The second one is predictive. Since there is no hypothetical assumption
embedded in this one, I think this question is trying to predict
something that is yet to happen, which is voter's likelihood of support
for the candidate whether or not is going to change.

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
mpg
?mpg

```

```{r}
# EX1
# create a histogram
qplot(mpg$hwy, geom="histogram",bins=40,binwidth=1, xlab = 'hwy', ylab = 'count') 
```

If we group by hwy, I can see that the car with 26 miles per gallon in
highways has the most car, which is over 30. Next, the second most cars
is the cars with 18 miles per gallon in highways. There are few
outliners such as 44 hwy and 12 hwy but the number is small. Most of
cars are distributed in 14 hwy to 36 hwy.

```{r}
# EX2:
# Create a scatterplot
plot(mpg$hwy, mpg$cty, main="Relationship Between hwy and cty", xlab = 'hwy', ylab = 'cty')
```

I can see that the hwy and cty have a positive relationship. As the hwy
increases, tge cty also goes up.

```{r}
# EX3:
data<-mpg
data %>% ggplot(aes(x=manufacturer))+geom_bar(aes(fill=manufacturer))+coord_flip()

```

By inspection, the Dodge manufacturer produced the most cars and Lincoln
produced the least.

```{r}
# EX4:
boxplot(mpg$hwy~ mpg$cyl)
```

It seems that as the cylinder increases, the boxplot of hwy moves
downwards.

```{r}
# EX5:
install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
?mpg

```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

#Because cor(mpg) x has to be numerical so I removed the categorical variables myself
data<- mpg %>% select(cyl,cty,hwy,displ)
m=cor(data)
corrplot(m, method = 'square', order ='FPC',type = 'lower', diag = FALSE)




```

Blue represents positively correlated and red represents negatively
correlated. I use "+" to say positive relationship and vice versa.

hwy cty + displ cty - displ hwy - cyl cty - cyl hwy - cyl displ+

I think the relationship between hwy and cty match with my common sense,
but I am surprised that in fact the more cylinders, the less hwy and the
more engine displacement, the less hwy. These two puzzled me for a
while.
